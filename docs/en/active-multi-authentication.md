# Enabling Multi Authentication in Voila CMS

## Overview
**Multi Authentication** is a system of authentication in which multiple methods are used to verify a user's identity.  

When enabled, the CMS will require users to pass through multiple verification steps before gaining access.  

## How to Enable
- Go to **General Settings** in the CMS.  
- Find the option **Multi Authentication (On / Off)**.  
- Switch it **On** to activate multi-step authentication.  

## Authentication Flow
When Multi Authentication is enabled, the system enforces an additional verification step:  
1. After entering the standard login credentials, the system will **send a verification code to the userâ€™s registered email address**.  
2. The user must enter this code to complete the login process.
